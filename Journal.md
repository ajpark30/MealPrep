### Week 2

2/4 - 2/11

Tasks Completed:

 * log4j
 * Github
 
 Junit work was easy and I enjoyed working with testing.  I really like how I can put information into a file so I can learn more about my application.  
 GitHub caused problems that set me back a couple days.  Remember that you need to keep the passphrase and the apple keychain didn't seem to store it.
 When all else fails you should just reset your ssh key.
