[Time Log](TimeLog.md)

### Week 1

1/28 - 2/4 

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Set up IntelliJ
 * Connected to GitHub
 * Completed excerise one
 
 Gained general knowledge of Maven, I would feel comfortable explaining what maven does behind the scenes.

### Week 2

2/4 - 2/11

Tasks Completed:
 * Junit work
 * log4j
 * Github
 
 Junit work was easy and I enjoyed working with testing.  I really like how I can put information into a file so I can learn more about my application.  
 GitHub caused problems that set me back a couple days.  Remember that you need to keep the passphrase and the apple keychain didn't seem to store it.
 When all else fails you should just reset your ssh key. 

### Week 3

2/11 - 2/18

Tasks Completed:
 * Project set up
 * Watched custom tags videos and completed activity.  Couldn't find the time to get the exercise completed.
 
 I spent all my time this week working on my individual project.  I feel good after spending the time on it.

### Week 4

2/18 - 2/25
Tasks Completed:
 * Added log4j, hibernate, and user table to indie project.
 * Added ability to search for users by last name.
 
 I spent alot of time trying to get jstl to work.  I ran into an interested problem with web.xml not being right and the browser no responding to the tags.
 I need to spend a little more time reading about hibernate.
